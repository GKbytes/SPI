# SPI
Title : Communication Bridge between I2C and SPI Platform : RTL Coding (Verilog/System Verilog/VHDL) Duration : 1 Month Description : Both SPI and I2C are robust, stable communication protocols that are widely used in today's complex systems.The I2C bus has a minimum pin count requirement and therefore a smaller footprint on the board. The SPI bus provides a synchronized serial link with performance in MHz range.The project implements the bridge between the two protocols and serves as an interface between these two which allow direct communication and a solution to reduce development time and cost for complex embedded systems.
